## Networking Fundamentals Explorer

An interactive, password-protected web application for exploring a 6-day networking fundamentals curriculum, created for a Government sponsored, non- credit, College Program.

This project is a single-page application (SPA) that acts as an interactive hub for a networking fundamentals course. It features a two-column layout where users can navigate between a course overview and 6 distinct "days" of content.

The application is password-protected and uses JavaScript to dynamically render content, including custom HTML/CSS visualizations and a Chart.js-powered bar chart.

Features

🔐 Password Protection: Access to the course content is protected by a password, that would be provided by request.

📊 Interactive Overview: The "Overview" page features a Chart.js bar chart that visualizes the number of topics covered each day of the course.

🖥️ SPA-Style Navigation: A persistent vertical navigation on the left allows users to seamlessly switch between content modules without a full page reload.

🎨 Custom Visualizations: The application uses pure HTML and CSS to render custom diagrams for complex networking concepts, including:

An OSI 7-Layer Model diagram.

Visual icons for common network topologies (Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh).

A detailed comparison table for TCP vs. UDP.

🔗 Module Hub: Each day's module links out to a separate, detailed HTML file (e.g., 01. ch-01,02,03.html, 02. intro-to-osi.html, etc.), making **index.html** the central entry point for the entire course.

📱 Responsive Design: The layout is built with Tailwind CSS and is responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
